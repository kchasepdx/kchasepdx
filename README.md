- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Kristen Chase - a former financial professional turned software developer. After spending nearly a decade working in investment consulting I decided to change careers and focus on something I was truly passionate about - web development. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in frontend development!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can.
